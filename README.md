# 📱 IMEI Shield

## 🔒 Overview
IMEI Shield is a Web3-powered public reporting and verification system designed to combat phone theft and fraud.  
It allows individuals to register their devices, report stolen phones, and verify IMEIs before purchase.  
By making stolen phones harder to resell, IMEI Shield reduces theft incentives, improves safety, and builds trust in second-hand markets.
